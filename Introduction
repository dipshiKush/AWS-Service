1. Cloud Computing (Fundamentals)

Cloud computing refers to the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet, eliminating the need to buy, own, and maintain physical data centers and servers.

Instead of managing infrastructure, you can access services such as:

    Compute power (e.g., virtual servers)
    Storage (e.g., Amazon S3)
    Databases (e.g., Amazon RDS, DynamoDB)
    Networking (e.g., Amazon VPC)
    AI/ML, analytics, and security services

Key advantage: You pay only for what you use, when you use it‚Äîenabling cost savings, faster innovation, and the flexibility to scale as your needs evolve.

2. AWS Cloud

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world‚Äôs most comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform.
It provides a pay-as-you-go model where you can provision resources instantly and globally through a web interface, SDK, or APIs.
AWS cloud services support everything from startups to enterprise-level applications, offering tools to build, deploy, and manage applications securely and reliably at scale.

Real-World Use Case:
A startup wants to launch a mobile app. Instead of buying physical servers, they use AWS services like:
    Amazon EC2 for virtual servers
    Amazon S3 to store images and videos
    Amazon RDS for their backend database
    They save costs and scale instantly based on traffic.

3. AWS Cloud Benefits

Here‚Äôs why AWS is the leading cloud provider:

    ‚úÖ Cost-Effective: Pay only for the resources you use‚Äîno upfront hardware costs.
    üìà Scalable & Flexible: Instantly scale resources up/down using services like Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing.
    üîê Secure & Reliable: End-to-end encryption, compliance, and a shared responsibility model ensure enterprise-grade security.
    ‚ö° Agility & Speed: Provision infrastructure in minutes, experiment and innovate faster.
    üåç Global Infrastructure: With 100+ Availability Zones across 30+ geographic regions, AWS enables global reach with low latency.
    üéØ Ease of Use: Intuitive console, well-documented SDKs, APIs, and support for many programming languages.

4. Cloud Service Models

Cloud services are categorized into three primary models, and AWS provides offerings in all three:
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)- You get raw computing resources over the internet.

    You manage: OS, middleware, runtime, data, applications.
    AWS manages: Hardware, networking, virtualization.
    Example: Amazon EC2, Amazon VPC, Amazon EBS

PaaS (Platform as a Service) - Provides a platform to develop, run, and manage applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.
    
    You just focus on the application code.
    Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, AWS AppRunner

SaaS (Software as a Service) - Fully managed applications delivered via the cloud.

    End-users consume the service; no management of infrastructure or platform.
    Example: Amazon Chime (communications), AWS QuickSight (BI tool)
